## Training Setup

The following is needed to train a CNN.

### Pipeline

A [training pipeline](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/object_detection/g3doc/configuring_jobs.md) in a [protobuf file](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial) contains configurations for the model type (`model`), training model parameters (`train_config`), metrics that will be reported (`eval_config`), and what datasets the model will be trained (`train_input_config`) and evaluated on (`eval_input_config`).  The TensorFlow github repo contains [example training pipeline files](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection/samples/configs), most of which are configurations used on the [Oxford-IIIT Pets Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/).
