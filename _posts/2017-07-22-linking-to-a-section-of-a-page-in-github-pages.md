## Heading Anchors

If you want to link to a specific section of a blog or project, you can use an anchor link.  This way you can send readers directly to a section you're referring to, or create a table of contents at the beginning.  To create an anchor to a section on the same page, use a `#` then the section name in lower case with a `-` instead of spaces.  For example, to link to [the next secttion of this post](#other-pages), you would use `[some words](#other-pages)`.



## Other Pages

If you click on the link above, you can see that the html for the page now has `#other-pages` at the end.  This shows that if you want to link to a section of another page, you can just put the anchor link at the end of the html for the page.
