I used Keras to train a Convolutional Neural Network on the MNIST data set on AWS (g2.2xlarge GPU), and changed parameters to see how the training would change.  For each of the following, I did 3 epochs with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Batch size: 16
Epoch 1: l
| | Epoch 1 | Epoch 2 | Epoch 3 | | |
| Batch Size | Loss, Acc. | Loss, Acc. | Loss, Acc. | Test Loss, Acc. | Total Time (s) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 16     | 0.2202, 0.9339 | 0.0931, 0.9728 | 0.0744, 0.9783 | 0.04339, 0.9858 | 443 |
| 32     |  |  |  | 443 |  |
