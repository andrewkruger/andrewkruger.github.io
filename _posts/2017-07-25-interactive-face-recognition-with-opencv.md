## OpenCV, PyImageSearch, and Facial Landmark Detection

[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) is a computer vision library for Python, C++, C, and Java that is commonly used in data science when working with images.  People have created great tutorials and supporting programs, for example [PyImageSearch](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/).  PyImageSearch has a [facial landmark detector](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/17/real-time-facial-landmark-detection-opencv-python-dlib/) for Python that doesn't just do facial recognition, but identifies the location and shape of the parts of the face.  

These landmarks are indicated with red dots:
