*Dracula, Daniel Deronda, Weiland, Clarissa, The Princess de Cleves.* What do all of these novels have in common? They have tendencies to almost always tie gender to representations of a creature. These creatures usually have specific moral implications. In *Dracula*, Mina is described as the angel of the household, Dracula’s masculinity is tied to his vampirism; in *Clarissa*, Lovelace is a self-described demon-lover to the angelic Clarissa. Why is gender linked to monstrous representation? And what does the phenomenon say about literary culture as a whole?

Realist and surrealist literature looks very different from the outside; but on the inside there is a consistent interest, only differing in portrayal, in demonizing genders. Sometimes it is the male gender that becomes like an angel, such as in *Daniel Deronda*, where the title character is worshipped by his feminine foil, Gwendolen Harleth, who calls herself a demon. Sometimes the female is anglicized, such as in the aforementioned case of Clarissa. Either way, the 18th and 19th centuries seem to be a time where gender was very much linked with metaphors about ethics and creatural representations of said relationship.

Through the study of both traditional close-reading and literary criticism; and integrating non-traditional Digital Humanities methods such as topic modeling, my hope is that the convergence of both methods will lend a three-dimesional understanding of a topic popular in academic circles previously unresearched from such an angle.

The website is spliced into two sections: in [Gendered Full Body Text](http://nmd-alessio.com/home/demonology/), I have complied a list of plain text files from which I’ve pulled my topic modeling data. The data is based off a list of END’s data research and the webpage is where the files that I will pull my generative model are housed.

You can read more about the literary criticism aspect of my project in the periodical [blog posts](http://nmd-alessio.com/home/) attached to the homepage. My hope with the Digital Humanities research on all other tabs is that a large-scale review of vast bodies of text over a large period of time will add a larger significance to the phenomenon and hopefully update the current academic conversation about gender studies.
