Our day-to-day summer work takes place primarily at the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Rare Book and Manuscript Library, located on the 6th floor of the Van Pelt Library, and they provide us with crucial staff and funding resources.

Swarthmore College has been integral to the project by generously providing funding to students for their participation, has has the Tri-Co Digital Humanities Initiative. Funding for students has also been provided by the University of Pennsylvania and Bryn Mawr College.

Institutions who have worked with us to include parts of their collections include Bryn Mawr College, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Rosenbach Museum and Library, Haverford College, Swarthmore College, Columbia University, and New York University. By branching out to these other institutions to expand the number of titles and records in the database, we hope to make the database more representative of early English-language novels worldwide and provide users with valuable additional copy-specific information by collecting records for multiple copies of existing titles.
