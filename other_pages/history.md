The Early Novels Database is led by Rachel Sagner Buurma, Professor of English literature at Swarthmore College, and Jon Shaw, Director of Logistics and Access Services at the University of Pennsylvania’s Van Pelt-Dietrich Library in collaboration with the Penn Rare Books and Manuscripts Department. Since its founding, END has grown to include records for over 1,800 novels from collections at the Penn Libraries’ Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts and a number of Philadelphia-area repositories (the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Rosenbach Museum and Library, the Swarthmore Libraries Rare Book Room, and Bryn Mawr College Special Collections), as well as the Fales Library at New York University. Undergraduate researchers from Penn, the Tri-College Consortium (Swarthmore, Haverford, and Bryn Mawr), and LACOL (Liberal Arts Consortium for Online Learning) member institutions have contributed to the project.

## Winter 2013: Launch of END First Edition

By the end of 2013, the team hopes to release END First Edition, the first public version of the database containing 1200 records, and to begin to disseminate our data and project, seek formal peer review and additional partnerships.

## Fall 2013: Populating the Database, Developing Partnerships, Topic Modeling Project

For the first time, significant work on END at both Swarthmore and Penn will continue into the fall semester. The summer 2013 END team will continue cataloging at Penn, Swarthmore, and the Rosenbach and will work to clean record clean records; we will work to populate the database; and we will explore a topic modeling project [link] designed as one demonstration of our our metadata complements full-text archives and projects. We are also working with Swarthmore College’s [Introduction to Computer Science (CS21)](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~richardw/cs21/) to develop a lab assignment using our data and with Haverford College’s New(s) Media and Print Culture (ENGL346a) as one demonstration of how to think about the role of bibliographic databases and interfaces in scholarly research.

## Summer 2013: Developing a User Interface

The END project team worked towards three main goals this summer. First, student workers continued cataloging novels in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library while also finalizing cataloging form and interface. Second, we developed a new website, a project led by our Tri-Co Digital humanities undergraduate fellow. Third, we expanded on previous summers’ pilot partnerships with the Library Company of Philadelphia and Bryn Mawr’s Canaday Library to pursue partnerships with the Rosenbach Library and Swarthmore College’s McCabe Library. We also developed two new projects: an investigation of how to use social media to extend awareness of END – primarily supported by a student holding an END-specific Tri-Co Digital Humanities Internship – and the first stages of an academic article based partly on evidence generated from END on footnotes in early novels. The Friday morning seminar continued to be an ongoing feature of the END project. [Add link to a larger summer 2013 overview of events.]

## 2012: END’s Educational Component and Social Media Presence

During this summer END accomplished two goals: successfully piloting END cataloging at a private library (the Library Company of Philadelphia), which involved major changes in project management and technology use, and starting to explore social media technologies to disseminate END to potential audiences.

This summer also saw the extension and formalization of END’s educational component. In addition to week-long training in cataloging procedure,  students learned about intellectual questions and theory related to 18th century novels and print culture. The END team also instituted a Friday-morning seminar from 9 am to 12 or 1 pm. The seminar continues to be a place for reflection on what students notice and find interesting about the novels. The seminar is also a time used for discussion of academic readings and visits by experts on eighteenth-century novels and descriptive bibliography. Students enjoyed about 30 hours of seminar-style classroom-type work during the summer of 2012, a model which will continue into the future of the project.

The seminar also supported involvement by students who developed independent projects related to the END project.

The database was updated during the 2012-2013 academic year by Penn’s Digital Library Architecture group. A Penn-employed student also cleaned and updated records for the database.

## 2010-2011: Building Institutional Partnerships

During the 2010-2011 academic year, END began working with Bryn Mawr’s special collections library to pilot 1) the inclusion of novels from other institutions and 2) the inclusion of novels in languages other than English, beginning with French novels.

In the summer of 2011, END added over 500 new records to the database, making the database usable for researchers. The team also began researching grants and other institutional partnerships, research which has borne some fruit and carried over to the summer of 2012.

During the 2011 academic year an END undergraduate researcher from the University of Pennsylvania worked to debug the database and clean up previously created records. She also conducted informal interviews with experts on eighteenth-century literature and print culture, the results of which helped END fine-tune the database and prepare for more formal peer review (including a user survey and submission to the digital humanities clearinghouse 18th Connect).

END also successfully applied to the Tri-Co Digital Humanities Initiative for funding for two sophomore students from Swarthmore College to work as END student researchers during the summer of 2012.

## 2009-2010: Database Development and Population

During the summers of 2009 and 2010, the END team developed a functioning prototype database populated with more than 200 information-rich records. Students worked to debug the database and alter pre-existing records to make the database fully functional to researchers.

## Longer History: The Transatlantic Fiction Project

END had its origins in the Transatlantic Fiction Project, an earlier discontinued project based on British and American novels held by the University of Pennsylvania and run by Michael Gamer and Lynne Farrington assisted by Rachel Sagner Buurma, Dahlia Porter (University of North Texas), and Ruth McAdams (University of Michigan), and others. In collaboration with Michael and Lynne, END has drawn on and revised the TFP’s extensive work identifying relevant metadata fields and creating an initial composite collection of fiction held in Penn’s Rare Book and Manuscript Collection (the [Collection of British and American Fiction, 1660-1830](http://franklin.library.upenn.edu/search.html?q=Collection%20of%20British%20and%20American%20Fiction%201660%201830%20%28University%20of%20Pennsylvania%29&qt=dla-author)). The TFP’s work was funded in part by grants from the Penn Research Foundation.
